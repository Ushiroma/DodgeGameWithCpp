Description: This projects marks the beginning of me chasing my love for c++ and game dev.
With the use of raylib, this project was used to practise adding objects and applying math to them to create movement and collision detection
This project also marks my first serious project in learning programming maths for game dev despite it's simplicity

This project was aided by countless research and youtube shorts and the original idea belonged to Stephen from GameDev.tv.
However i changed the mechanic from the box going up and down to an attempt to simulate boxes spawning in random positions on the x-axis
